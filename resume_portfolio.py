Additionally, I created an **APK using FFMPEG** to convert pixelated images into videos for black frame verification, and performed **web scraping with BeautifulSoup and Requests** to gather user reviews, transforming them into a CSV dataset for **sentiment analysis**. I dove headfirst into the world of **Automation and Machine Learning**. From scripting snazzy user interfaces to brewing up **predictive ML models**. My dedication and knack for tinkering with tech not only earned me appreciations and recognition but also set the stage for bigger adventures ahead."
